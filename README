CCMagic is the "Custom Content" management program for users of Electronic Art's The Sims 3 game.

The program is licensed under the GPL and is the user interface to the CC Magic content management program.

For more information on CC-Magic or to contact the author, please visit http://sims3.the-prof.net/forums/

This program is essentially an WPF gui wrapped over the top of the S3ToolKit.MagicEngine component.
  
  
NOTE:  
  Developers are encouraged to check out all projects in this series into the same folder tree so that the
  Visual Studio solution files can find the subordinate projects.  To build the project, you should only need
  to have the CC Magic solution loaded as it will load the projects from the other solutions automatically.
